        <h2>5 Office Space Tasks to Plan Before Going Back to Work</h2>
        <h3>Getting ahead of employee concerns with these 5 plans</h3>
        <p>
          As companies look ahead to the future of work after the pandemic, they’re navigating uncharted waters. Businesses and employees are struggling to understand shifting state and local guidance, to adhere to regulations and, most of all, to make sure that
          workspaces are safe, healthy and ready to welcome people back into them. They’re also leveraging digital tools and technologies in new ways – to facilitate collaboration, to ensure capacity limits aren’t exceeded, and to keep people safe and
          secure – as they incorporate new protocols into daily office routines.
        </p>
        <p>
          What considerations should employers keep in mind when planning the return to office after COVID?

                    <br> Many areas have lifted restrictions on many industries, but not all, and guidelines and best practices continue to evolve along with the science.

                    The CDC still recommends that people maintain six-foot distancing from others who are not in their household; OSHA recommends staggering work shifts, limiting breakroom capacity and putting measures in place to reduce the number of people who are in the
                    same space at once.

                    <br> Monitoring the total number of people in buildings as well as how they’re distributed within indoor spaces is now a best practice, because it makes it possible to adhere to CDC and OSHA recommendations

                    <br> Automated access counting systems make it easy to collect and monitor the necessary data.

                  Replacing high-touch surfaces in common areas with touchless solutions further reduces the in-office risk to employees.
                  <br><br> Areas where you should consider implementing touchless controls include entry and access, elevators and visitor management.
                  <br><br> Reminding workers of no-touch adaptations in the workplace (as well as increase cleaning and sanitization procedures) can help increase their trust and confidence that they’ll remain safe as they return to work.

                <p class="section-description">
                  Many workplaces are adopting hybrid models that allow for more employees to work from home more often, and thus are using hot-desking or hoteling (temporarily assigned seating). Informing employees about sanitization procedures is especially important
                  in these scenarios.
                  <br><br> Your organization can integrate desk scheduling with access monitoring and sanitization scheduling solutions to ensure that shared workspaces are cleaned between times they’re occupied.
